# Bayes_GGP
## is written in Phython tha implements a Bayesian approach to estimate the time-average geomagnetic field mean and paleosecular variation and their uncertainties underpinned by the projected normal distribution. 
## The proposed method can directly work with paleomagnetic directional data without reference to experimental intensities.
# Bayes_GGP contains two files: main.py and PN_Bayes.py
## main.py includes the Bayesian regression and estimation framework using the MCMC method, and three sub functions that contain three different choices to update the variation parameters, ![\bm \xi.]  
## Py_Bayes.py includes the data augmentation approach to update the intensities, and other functions to support the main scheme.
